# intERPrise Easycom Sample Interface 1.0
A sample interface that uses Easycom for UI build.

## Installation Instructions
* If not already done install Easycom on the IBM i server where the intERPrise data and object reside
* Configure Easycom and install the license key
* Create a web server instance which is able to connect to the IBM i where Easycom is installed
* Copy the source code to the web instance directory.
* The set up of a name based Virtual host is recommended
* Start the web server instance
* Connect via browser, can only connect at this stage with user and password.

This is a very early sample which is only able to connect to the IBM i server and logout. Once we have a working Database and environment we 
will  add the interfaces to display the data contained in the database and some level of updaate capability.
